# build_car_classifier
goal:
* Load the dataset and do preliminary exploration. Since we're starting with a pre-labeled dataset we get to skip all the data cleaning.
* Do some preprocessing to prepare for building a model.
* Build a toy model on a small piece of the dataset to get a pipeline working
* Try to build an SUV/car/other classifier using just these images.
* Try transfer learning by fine-tuning squeezenet
-See how much we can gain via data augmentation
-Try the classifer on new images from the internet...
-if we want to go crazy, we can scrape a bunch more car photos from the internet and try out unsupervised pre-training.
